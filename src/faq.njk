                    <div class="faq-answer-inner">Nope. All sessions are by appointment only. This gives me time to design your custom piece and make sure I can give you my full attention. Book through the <a href="/book/" style="color: var(--accent);">booking page</a>.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer-inner">Usually 2-4 weeks out, sometimes longer for bigger pieces. If you have a specific date in mind (birthday, anniversary, etc.), reach out early to lock it in.</div>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <div class="faq-answer-inner">Nope. I create custom designs for every client. Just bring your idea — it can be a rough sketch, reference photos, a description, whatever. We'll work together to create something you'll love. The final design is done before your appointment.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer-inner">My rate is $150/hour with a 2-hour minimum ($300). Final price depends on size, detail, and placement.

                    <div class="faq-answer-inner">Yes. A deposit is required to book your appointment. It's non-refundable if you cancel with less than 24 hours notice or no-show. The deposit goes toward your tattoo — it's not an extra fee.</div>

                    <div class="faq-answer-inner">Real talk — yes, it's going to hurt some. Pain levels depend on placement, your personal tolerance, and how well you prepared (sleep, food, hydration). Some spots are worse than others. Ribs, spine, inner arm, and feet tend to be more sensitive. But most people handle it fine. We'll take breaks when you need them.</div>

        <p style="color: var(--cream); max-width: 700px; margin-bottom: 3rem;">How you take care of your tattoo in the first few weeks determines how it heals. Follow these instructions and your ink will look fresh for years.</p>

                <h3>Day 1 (First 24 Hours)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leave the bandage on for 2-4 hours</li>
                    <li>Wash gently with unscented soap and lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>Pat dry with a clean paper towel (no regular towels)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Wash 2-3 times daily with unscented soap</li>
                    <li>Apply thin layer of lotion after each wash</li>
                    <li>Don't soak it — no baths, pools, or hot tubs</li>
                    <li>Keep it out of direct sunlight</li>
                    <li>Wear loose clothing over the area</li>
                    <li>Don't scratch or pick at it (it will itch)</li>

                    <li>Peeling and flaking is normal — don't pick</li>

                <h3>Long-Term Care</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Always use sunscreen on your tattoo (SPF 30+)</li>
                    <li>Keep skin moisturized</li>
                    <li>Sun exposure fades tattoos over time</li>
                    <li>Touch-ups are available if needed</li>
                    <li>Reach out if you have any concerns</li>

        <div style="background: var(--dark); padding: 2rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--red); margin-top: 3rem;">
            <h3 style="color: var(--red); font-family: var(--font-display); font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">WHEN TO CONTACT ME OR A DOCTOR</h3>
            <p style="color: var(--cream); font-size: 0.95rem;">Some redness and swelling is normal for the first few days. But reach out if you notice: excessive swelling that doesn't go down, pus or discharge (clear fluid is normal), fever, red streaks spreading from the tattoo, or severe pain after the first couple days. These could be signs of infection.</p>
