Just updated the portfolio with some recent work. Got a few portraits done this month that I'm really proud of, plus wrapped up a full sleeve project that took about 20 hours total.

Check out the [portfolio page](/portfolio/) to see the new pieces.

If you're thinking about getting some work done, hit the booking page to schedule a consultation. I'm booking about 3 weeks out right now.
