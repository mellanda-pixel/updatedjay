                <h2>What's Up, I'm J</h2>
                <p>I'm a tattoo artist based in Atlanta, Georgia. I specialize in black and gray work — portraits, realism, and custom pieces. What started as a passion for art turned into a career I genuinely love.</p>
                
                <p>I got into tattooing because I wanted to create something permanent, something meaningful. Every tattoo tells a story, and I take that seriously. Whether it's a portrait of someone you love, a piece that represents a chapter of your life, or just something that looks dope — I'm here to make it happen.</p>
                
                <p>My style is all about clean lines, smooth shading, and attention to detail. I don't do flash or cookie-cutter designs. Every piece I create is custom, designed specifically for you and your body. You bring the idea, I'll make it hit.</p>
                
                <p>When I'm not tattooing, I'm probably drawing, checking out other artists' work, or just vibing. I believe in keeping things chill — no egos, no drama. Just good conversations and great tattoos.</p>

                <h3>Where I Work</h3>
                <p>I work out of a professional tattoo shop in Atlanta. Clean, comfortable, and set up right. The vibe is relaxed but the work is serious.</p>
                
                <h3>By Appointment Only</h3>
                <p>I don't do walk-ins. Every session is booked in advance so I can give each client my full attention. This also gives me time to design your custom piece before you even sit in the chair.</p>
                
                <div class="appointment-notice">
                    <p><strong>Heads up:</strong> I book out a few weeks in advance, especially for larger pieces. If you've got a specific date in mind (birthday, anniversary, etc.), book early.</p>
